# Translation

We will use a web service to perform translation for us. Your assignment is to change the translated text to upper case if the translated text is shorter than 8 characters but to leave it alone otherwise.

## Usage

First, run

```bash
npm install
```

As an example, to translate from English to French, run

```bash
npm start en fr 'hello from America'
```

To see all language codes, run

```bash
npm start
```
